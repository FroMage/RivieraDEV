# How to run the Riviera DEV web site

Note: at the moment it requires Play 1.5.3.

1. Download and install [jdk-11](https://jdk.java.net/java-se-ri/11)
    - On Windows: [Installation instructions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52511778/how-to-install-openjdk-11-on-windows)
2. Download [Python 2](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2717/) and install it
3. Download [Play Framework 1.5.3](https://downloads.typesafe.com/play/1.5.3/play-1.5.3.zip) and install it
    - [Installation guide](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/1.5.x/install)
4. Clone the [RivieraDEV repository](https://github.com/FroMage/RivieraDEV)
5. Download and install [Postgres 9 or 11](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) on port 5433
    - On Windows, add `<path_to_postres>\bin` to the `Path` in Environment Variables
6. Open a shell and go to the `RivieraDEV` directory you just cloned
7. Create your Postgres DB (9.x)
    - On Linux:
        1. `sudo su - postgres`
        2. `createuser -p 5433 -PSRD rivieradev`
        3. _enter `rivieradev` as password when prompted_
        4. `createdb -p 5433 -O rivieradev -E utf8 rivieradev-2021`
        5. exit
    - On Windows:
        1. `createuser -U postgres -p 5433 -PSRD rivieradev`
        2. _enter `rivieradev` as password when prompted_
        3. _enter the postgres password chosen during the installation when prompted_
        4. `createdb -U postgres -p 5433 -O rivieradev -E utf8 rivieradev-2021`
        5. _enter the postgres password chosen during the installation when prompted_
8. Play (on Windows, you might need to run the following commands in a Powershell run as an Administrator)
    1. Download the module dependencies
        - `play dependencies --forProd`
    2. Run the application
        - `play run`
9. You can visit the website at http://localhost:9001/ (if the text is not translated, just refresh)

# How to make your user (if registration is disabled, which is the default for now)

This can only be done by hand for now:

1. Pick a password
1. Open a `psql` console to your database:
    1. `psql -p 5433 -h localhost -U rivieradev rivieradev-2021`
1. Add your user (as admin)
    1. `INSERT INTO user_table (id, firstname, lastname, password, username) VALUES ((select nextval('hibernate_sequence')), 'FirstName', 'LastName', 'Password', 'UserName');`
1. You can now log in and change your password using the UI

# Configuration

In the admin part (https://\<url\>/admin) there is a special table `Configurations`. All the keys are in defined in `app/models/ConfigurationKey.java`.

Here is how to configure it.

## Launch of the new edition

When we set up the website for the new edition.

-   `GOOGLE_MAP_API_KEY`: Reuse the same key as for the previous edition
-   `EVENT_START_DATE`: Start date of the conference in ISO format. E.g. `2019-05-15T08:20:00`
-   `EVENT_START_DATE`: End date of the conference in ISO format: E.g. `2019-05-17T18:00:00`
-   `DISPLAY_FULL_SCHEDULE = false`: We don't want to display the schedule because we don't know it yet.
-   `DISPLAY_NEW_SPEAKERS = false`: Same as above.
-   `DISPLAY_TALKS = false`: Same as above.
-   `PROMOTED_PAGE`: It's for the primary button shown on the home page below the logo. The possible values are be `CFP`, `TICKETS` or `SPONSORS`. At this time it's a bit tricky because none of them is available 😅 So let's not use it for now.
-   `PROMOTED_PAGE_2`; It's the same as above but for the secondary button. The possible values are `CFP`, `SPONSORS` and `SCHEDULE`. And it's the same, let's not use it for now.
-   `TICKETING_URL`: At this time the ticketing is not opened yet, but if we already know the URL, we can fill it.
-   `TICKETING_OPEN = false`
-   `TICKETING_TRAINING_URL`: To be filled with the URL provided by the training organization, but you probably don't know it yet
-   `TICKETING_TRAINING_OPEN = false` The training organization is not ready yet
-   `SPONSORING_LEAFLET_URL`: URL to the sponsoring leaflet.
-   `CFP_URL`: At this time the CFP is not opened yet, but if we know the URL, we can fill it.
-   `CFP_OPEN = false`

## When the sponsoring leaflet is ready

-   `SPONSORING_LEAFLET_URL`: URL to the sponsoring leaflet if not already filled.
-   `PROMOTED_PAGE = 'SPONSORS'`

## When we open the CFP

-   `CFP_URL`: Fill it if it's not already done.
-   `CFP_OPEN = true`
-   `PROMOTED_PAGE = CFP`
-   `PROMOTED_PAGE_2 = SPONSORS` as soon as the leaflet is ready

## When we open the ticketing

-   `TICKETING_URL`: Fill it if it's not already done.
-   `TICKETING_OPEN = true`

Don't forget to fill the tables `PricePacks` and `PricePackDates`.

## When the training organization is ready

-   `TICKETING_TRAINING_URL`: Fill it if it's not already done.
-   `TICKETING_TRAINING_OPEN = true`

## When we close the CFP

-   `CFP_OPEN = false`
-   `PROMOTED_PAGE = TICKETS`

## When some talks and speakers are known

Before changing the configuration, we need to add some talks and speakers.

-   `DISPLAY_TALKS = true`
-   `DISPLAY_NEW_SPEAKERS = true`

## When the full schedule is known

-   `DISPLAY_FULL_SCHEDULE = true`
-   `PROMOTED_PAGE_2 = SCHEDULE`

## When we close the ticketing

-   `TICKETING_OPEN = false`
-   `PROMOTED_PAGE = SPONSORS`
