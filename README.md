# How to make your user (if registration is disabled, which is the default for now)

This can only be done by hand for now:

1. Pick a password
1. Open a `psql` console to your database:
    1. `psql -p 5433 -h localhost -U rivieradev rivieradev-2020`
1. Add your user (as admin)
    1. `INSERT INTO user_table (id, firstname, lastname, password, username) VALUES ((select nextval('hibernate_sequence')), 'FirstName', 'LastName', 'Password', 'UserName');`
1. You can now log in and change your password using the UI

# Configuration

In the admin part (https://\<url\>/admin) there is a special table `Configurations`. All the keys are in defined in `app/models/ConfigurationKey.java`.

Here is how to configure it.

## Launch of the new edition

When we set up the website for the new edition.

-   `GOOGLE_MAP_API_KEY`: Reuse the same key as for the previous edition
-   `EVENT_START_DATE`: Start date of the conference in ISO format. E.g. `2019-05-15T08:20:00`
-   `EVENT_START_DATE`: End date of the conference in ISO format: E.g. `2019-05-17T18:00:00`
-   `DISPLAY_FULL_SCHEDULE = false`: We don't want to display the schedule because we don't know it yet.
-   `DISPLAY_NEW_SPEAKERS = false`: Same as above.
-   `DISPLAY_TALKS = false`: Same as above.
-   `PROMOTED_PAGE`: It's for the primary button shown on the home page below the logo. The possible values are be `CFP`, `TICKETS` or `SPONSORS`. At this time it's a bit tricky because none of them is available ðŸ˜… So let's not use it for now.
-   `PROMOTED_PAGE_2`; It's the same as above but for the secondary button. The possible values are `SPONSORS` and `SCHEDULE`. And it's the same, let's not use it for now.
-   `TICKETING_URL`: At this time the ticketing is not opened yet, but if we already know the URL, we can fill it.
-   `TICKETING_OPEN = false`
-   `SPONSORING_LEAFLET_URL`: URL to the sponsoring leaflet.
-   `CFP_URL`: At this time the CFP is not opened yet, but if we know the URL, we can fill it.
-   `CFP_OPEN = false`

## When the sponsoring leaflet is ready

-   `SPONSORING_LEAFLET_URL`: URL to the sponsoring leaflet if not already filled.
-   `PROMOTED_PAGE = 'SPONSORS'`

## When we open the CFP

-   `CFP_URL`: Fill it if it's not already done.
-   `CFP_OPEN = true`
-   `PROMOTED_PAGE = CFP`
-   `PROMOTED_PAGE_2 = SPONSORS` as soon as the leaflet is ready

## When we open the ticketing

-   `TICKETING_URL`: Fill it if it's not already done.
-   `TICKETING_OPEN = true`

## When we close the CFP

-   `CFP_OPEN = false`
-   `PROMOTED_PAGE = TICKETS`

## When some talks and speakers are known

Before changing the configuration, we need to add some talks and speakers.

-   `DISPLAY_TALKS = true`
-   `DISPLAY_NEW_SPEAKERS = true`

## When the full schedule is known

-   `DISPLAY_FULL_SCHEDULE = true`
-   `PROMOTED_PAGE_2 = SCHEDULE`

## When we close the ticketing

-   `TICKETING_OPEN = false`
-   `PROMOTED_PAGE = SPONSORS`
